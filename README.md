# snow_scaling
The code in the repository documents and demonstrates a workflow for generating variograms for 
[Airborne Snow Observatory](https://www.airbornesnowobservatories.com/) (ASO) lidar data collected 
over the headwaters of the Tuolomne river basin, CA.

The repository holds original code deveopled by **add Ian's full name here**.  Workflows developed by **Ian**
are documented in [**LINK TO NOTEBOOK**]().  [Results](link_to_pdf_of_powerpoint) of this analysis were 
presented at **name_of_conference**.

The original workflow was modified by Andy Barrett to use standard variogram functions from `skimage-learn`.  This workflow is 
documented in [**LINK TO MODIFIED WORKBOOK**]().

Data are available from NSIDC **add link to dataset**.
